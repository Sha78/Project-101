<h2>Today's Personal Blog/Journal Post </h2>
<section>
    <p>Today is 7-27-2019 I woke up at about 12:00pm becasue I stayed up pretty late. After I woke up I got something to eat then did the usual things to start the day off. After I got ready for the day I went to the surf shop and got my nephew a wetsuit. Then I headed to Subway to get a bite to eat. I ordered a Marinara Meatball sub and some water.</p> 
    <p>When I got back to the house I got on the laptop and started reading about the vim editor. I used the vim editor before but I quickly realized that I needed to refresh my memory. The last time that I used the vim editor was almost 7 months ago when I took a linux class at CCSF. It really bolggles my mind how easy it is to forget things so quickly when you don't use the things that you learned.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I think that is it for my blog/journal today. I probably will make corecctions to it later and add things if I want to.</p>
